an electric guitar from scratch!!!!???? (kind of, not really)., but it is an electric guitar :). this was made because i wanted to challenge myself with things related to woodworking, painting, cad and wiring stuff :D. ive always wanted an electric guitar, but with highway, i thought, why not make one!. the guitar also has a single coil neck + humbucker bridge which isnt something common you can find :3.
