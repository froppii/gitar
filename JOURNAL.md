**26 May - Started a BOM + research**

Watched some yt vids etc on how to make a guitar :D. I was having a hard time trying to decide whether i should make a telecaster or a stratocaster, decided to go with the strat because it is just more versatile in general(and it could do dive bombs!). 

**Time spent: 30 mins**

**30 May - Completed BOM**

Continued and finished BOM :3

**2 June - CAD!!!**

I finished the cad which I kind of worked on for 2ish days but did not make a journal submission yesterday, that being said i think im all set to submit the form! I did some changes to the BOM and overall design, and now its a single coil neck pickup(it has a humbucker case cuz it looks cool though) with a humbucker bridge pickup :DDD
